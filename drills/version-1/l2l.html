    <h2>Learn to Learn: Git.</h2>
    <p>May 1st, 2018</p>
    <p>Git, what the hell is this? A bunch of weird ass commands taking you all over your computer to stream line the whole process of writing code, backing it up to a site like github, and sharing it with your friends, colleagues, or whoever else? Tasty.</p>
    <p> I know I suck with computers on a fundamental level. Like, completely clueless, seriously, but who knows, maybe that will give me an advantage in some weird round about way. First things first, I have to set the stage, lets close steepandcheep, cant
      afford any decent gear right now anyways.</p>
    <p> Pandora? I like working to music, but it might be beneficial to discuss this stuff with my brother and some of the others in our class, bye bye DJ shadow! I guess I will put the headphones away. What else can I do?</p>
    <p> I know how to use the terminal, (I mean, I don't, but maybe a little, at least fundamentally). Perhaps there is a way to clean that up too, reading the Git drill instructions, it looks like I will be starting in my desktop quite a bit, and knowing
      me, I will be fucking up and restarting quite a bit. so lets use the terminal and move all of these files somewhere else in the computer. Now I can keep this drill on the Desktop and not run the risk of mixing it up with the other shit I have saved
      on to this thing over the last few days.</p>
    <p> Alright, the only thing in my web browser is the drill instructions, the terminal is open and on my minimalist desktop, waiting for me to start breaking shit... I mean exploring. AND I just had two granola bars. Lets Git mother fuckers.</p>
    <p> Now, lets look at these instructions, hmmm.. in the terminal course there were a lot more prompts written out in the drill. How the hell do you back out of multiple directories at once? Well, we still don't have access to our curriculum as of writing
      this, so lets hit google. It appears that ../../ continuing will take you back as many directories as you need, lets give that a try. Sweet! That works great, lets try some more weird shit.</p>
    <p> (2ish hours later) Alright guys, I have officially opened my 6th tab, I think this will be the one I get clean all the way through. How are you guys doing? Nope, you just want to type git commit origin master... yup just like that. We finally got
      the hang of it after a while.</p>
    <p> Setting the stage was crucial to our success, by the time we wrapped up the first two exercises, there were four of us working through it as a small group, taking turns (confidently) googling answers and trying stuff out. If something clicked for
      one of us, we would explain the process to the others, but without just handing it to them, allowing all of us to truly comprehend it.</p>
    <p> Having the clear work space, no distracting websites, music, or pop ups, allowed all of us to concentrate on the task at hand, never getting sidetracked by anything that wasn't beneficial to the process(other than one small conversation about a 93
      RX-7, whoops).</p>
    <p> It also allowed us to experiment and mess around with the process, but in a very productive, yet still enjoyable manner.</p>
    <p> In the future I hope to keep messing around with Git, and discovering new commands and work arounds to the problems it presents. I think it will be beneficial for me to do it alone this time, relying on the habits I picked up with the group to puzzle
      out any problems I run into.

    <h2>Learn to Learn: SMART.</h2>
    <p>May 5th, 2018</p>
    <p>SMART A learn to learn, blog like a summary of learning how to set goals to learn in a more efficient manner, lets see what we learned. This was a pretty new concept for me. I have definitely learned similar approaches to making SMART goals, but never
      with such a well explained process. This should really help me dial in my day to day planning once I fully grasp it.</p>
    <p> I am looking forward to writing about this one, because they really go hand in hand. Setting the stage can be crucial to the success of your SMART goals, and playing around with what your working on, while potentially seeming like a waste of time,
      could really increase your productivity, especially if you come to an epiphany on a part of the process linked to the task you are trying to complete. </p>
    <p> Now, I took some good notes at school, but need to really write this stuff out to fully comprehend it. And I am at home, which is chocked full of distractions. Lets try to set SMART goals to set the stage, to play with SMART. Yeah, that just happened.</p>
    <p> Now, I have like three hours before I should really get to bed, I know that I will work best in the little corner of my room where my desk is, but I also know that the house is a mess, and the whole house could use a cleaning. Not to mention I need
      to water the Lawn. I cant do all of it, we are in a pretty good sized house, and I can't half ass cleaning it. I have tried, and half way through I snap out of a trance and I am wiping floor boards or some shit, clueless as to how I got there.</P>
    <p> So, time to be Specific, Measurable, Acvievable, Realistic, and Timely. I know that I need to narrow down what I have to do, so that I can feel accomplished, but not spend all of my very valuable time getting there. So the whole house is out of the
      question, not nearly specific enough, The kitchen would only take about 45 minutes. That will be the ticket, I can put on some music, jam out, and clean my little OCD heart out.</p>
    <p> By the time I am done I can look back at a sparkling kitchen, everything cleaned and put back into it's very specific location, so thats pretty fucking measurable. Is it achievable? I clean all the time, i've got this no problem. It feels pretty realistic,
      much more so than doing the entire house, and that would leave me at least two hours to work on the SMART drills for bucket one, plent of time. lets do this.</p>
    <p> (52 Minutes and 17 seconds later... Yes, I fucking timed it.) God, that looks way better. I am sure the second the roommates get home tonight it will get trashed again, but thats not a problem, because I am leaving feeling accomplished, and excited
      to work on this SMART shit. Ten minutes later, and I have the Cat fed, the computer plugged in, some chill ass music quietly bumpin away in the background, and nothing open on my computer but the course work for SMART. So lets get learnt.</p>
    <p>
    I enjoy playing with SMART, I quickly recognize how easily you can set unrealistic, or completely unachievable goals for yourself, it's important to keep your goals simple, but precise, I can't just say read JavaScript for kids. What the fuck does
      that mean? The whole book? When and where? Am I reading it all in one sitting? How the hell am I going to retain all of that.</p>
    <p> Obviously I need to add some precision to that goal. Read one chapter of JavaScript for Kids and take notes on it. Close, but I am a slow reader, would an entire chapter take me more time than I want? will I fail to complete other tasks or goals to
      achieve this one? Lets try again. Read JavaScript for kids for 30 minutes and take notes as you read it.</p>
    <p> Thats much better, it is very specific, very measurable, pretty damn achievable, very realistic with tomorrow nights schedule, and has a very easy to measure/ track timeline. I think I am getting this SMART thing figured out. Having a clear "stage"
      really helped me dial in on this study session, I almost lost track of time.</p>
    <p> I had a few commercials on Pandora though, and one of them, a Harry's shaving commercial, worked its black magic, I got completely sucked in for some dumb reason, I think it will be beneficial to find a different music streaming site for while I am
      working on projects.</p>
    <p> SMART is incredibly helpful, I am hoping to incorporate into more of my day to day life. Flexibility is important, especially if I am going out on a date or trying to unwind, but it could really help expedite a lot of the smaller tasks I have to do
      throughout the day, allowing me to really work on big projects, or get the most out of free time.

    <h2>Learn to Learn: VS Code.</h2>
    <p>May 9th, 2018</p>
    <p>Visual Studio code Well well well, what do we have here? A code writing software that works better and more seamlessly than Atom, less memory usage, easier access to add-ons and preferences? I am very interested. Especially since I have no fucking
      idea how Atom works either.</p>
    <p> We are doing a breakout on it today too, which is fantastic, what better environment to start learning than right here at Galvanize!? Better wrap up lunch and get in there, I have to set up my stage, you know.</p>
    <p> I find a good seat early so I don't have to turn around in my swivel chair, get out my notepad and a pen (I like writing things by hand, helps me remember it all.) and put my computer on the desk in front of me. Ready.</p>
    <p> But whats this? another 7 minutes until James gets here to start preaching the gospel of VS Code? As a millennial, I cant let that time go idly by, i'd better open up facebook and scroll through the motorcycle pages I am a part of. How the hell did
      that guy end up in a salt mine?</p>
    <p> He's on a DR 650, Oh yeah, Emily was looking at getting one of those, better check craigslist. Three great looking bikes found and shared via social media. Oh look James is here, I hope he brings his Sax one day, they look so good together. Oh shit,
      my stage! </p>
    <p> Close tab Close tab Close tab! okay, much better, I'll open this program and see what he has to say. As James runs through all of these cool little add-ons and conversions, I jot them all down, helping solidify them into my brain, the second this
      breakout is done I will start fooling around with this stuff. But not for too long, I need to work on that learn to learn blog post so I can submit all of this shit tonight.</p>
    <p> I know, I will write it about VS code, holy shit! I am doing that right now! Fast forward to tonight, and my VS Code is glowing a mysterious red color and has rainbow spacing and colorful brackets all over it. Not to mention my terminal sitting neatly
      at the bottom of the screen, IN THE APPLICATION. Way better than Atom (I still have no idea, but I will believe it).</p>
    <p> It was fun playing with VS Code as I set it up, picking what extensions I liked and messing around with themes until I had it looking the way I wanted. I think I could have set my stage a bit better, I caught myself playing with the lock on my chair,
      but A.D.D. can strike at any time! I am excited to actually start writing code in VS, and becoming a straight up expert on this shit.
