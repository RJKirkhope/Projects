    <h1>Meet-Ups</h1>
    <h2>Meet-Up: Learn to Code.</h2>
    <p>May 2nd, 2018</p>
    <p>Meet-up number 1: Learn to code meet-up in the Galvanize basement. Classrooms one two and three. 6pm on Wednesday, May 2nd, 2018.</p>
    <p> We met Riley Price and Coleman Imhoff, Students in the G-77 Cohort, both of whom were helping James Mann Teach the program. They were both very good instructors and it was very nice to meet fellow students who were so excited to educate anyone and
      everyone.
    </p>
    <p> We learned that the meet-up takes place every week in the Galvanize basement. It is open to anyone and everyone who has an interest in learning how to code, whether starting at the absolute bottom, or trying to puzzle out more complex things like
      JavaScript. The instructors Split the groups up by language (HTML, CSS, and JS). From there they can really hone in on helping the people in their individual groups.</p>
    <p> We chose to attend the CSS class, since we were working on our CSS for our website building drills. It was a great environment to learn and concentrate on our projects in a familiar, comfortable environment. We were even able to give a few pointers
      to some other participants, which made us feel pretty good, and helped us understand our code even more.</P>
    <p> The questions I still have would be:<br> 1. Do the same teacher aids do it every week, or do they rotate/ show up when they want?<br> 2. Is there a certain level of competency you should be at before volunteering to run one of the classes?<br> 3.
      How many of the participants are returning multiple times and really committing to learning the curriculum?
    </p>

    <h2>Meet-Up: Beer Boarding.</h2>
    <p>May 3rd, 2018</p>
    <p>Meet-up Number 2: Beer Boarding meet-up in the mortal combat room of the Galvanize basement. 5pm on Thursday, May 3rd, 2018.</p>
    <p> We met Matt Hooper, a self taught freelance developer, who was preparing for job interviews by practicing his JS white boarding. We also met Emily Pancake, one of the people responsible for setting up the meet-up. The Benefit of the Beer Boarding
      meet-up, is that it helps prepare you for a common interview practice of solving JS problems on the spot. The practice can really help you dial in your presentation technique, and you can receive constructive feedback from your peers and the other
      participants.
    </p>
    <p> I learned that it is important to clarify exactly what the interviewer is asking, and to break it down and simplify the problem before starting. It is also very important to communicate what you are doing step by step to the interviewers, so they
      can really get a good read on how you problem solve.</p>
    <p> The questions I still have would be:<br> 1.Is it common for interviewers to ask more than a couple of JS questions for you to solve on the board? How many would be an average number?<br> 2.What are some other big interview techniques that could be
      thrown at me during my job search? How can I prepare for them? <br> 3.Matt Hooper is self-taught, how common is that in the industry at this point? Do you feel like it puts them at an advantage/ disadvantage?</p>
    <h2>Meet-Up: Denver Devs Happy Hour.</h2>
    <p>May 8th, 2018</p>
    <p>Meet-up Number 3: Denver Devs Happy Hour at the RINO Beer Garden. 6pm on Tuesday, May 8th, 2018.</p>
    <p> We met Alexandra Hughes, A hiring manager for DeeperPockets, a social media company that caters to Real Estate Developers. We also met Dylan, Jason, and Samual from Apto, a quickly growing start up that deals with Commercial real Estate companies.</p>
    <p> We found the Denver Devs meet-up very beneficial, It gave us an incredible opportunity to talk with several members of the Development community that have many years in the industry. They were all very willing to answer our questions and voice their
      opinions on best practices and approaches to entering the industry.</P>
    <p> It was very beneficial to talk with Samual, he has worked in the industry for about ten years, and has worked everywhere from big corporations to fresh start ups. It was nice hearing his perspectives on what is the best approach to starting a career,
      and how to approach getting hired in each environment.</p>
    <p> The Questions I still have would be:<br> 1.How common is it for Galvanize grads to find jobs through meet-ups like this one?<br> 2.Is it common for people who have connected at meet-ups to work on projects together outside of their careers?<br> 3.Is
      it common for companies to build/ start smaller meet-ups with the intention of attracting a specific clique of people to increase their chances of finding good candidates for hire?</p>
