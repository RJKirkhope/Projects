    <h1>SMART Goals.</h1>
    <h2>SMART: Day 1.</h2>
    <p>May 1st, 2018</p>
    <p>Complete an hour long leg workout before school.<br> Yes.<br> I woke up at 5am and didn’t hit snooze once. I got to the gym by 630 Am, giving me plenty of time to complete my exercises, as well as shower and get to school in a timely manner. Fitness
      is important for a healthy lifestyle, so being able to incorporate that into my busy schedule is a big win. One thing that didn’t go well was that I forgot to bring a change of clothes, so I was kinda sweaty all day, I will be adding a change of
      clothes to my bag tonight to better prepare for tomorrow.</p>
    <p> Spend an hour discussing the school day and plans for tomorrow with my brother.<br> Yes.<br> The traffic is very bad on the way home, so we take advantage of that time and actively talk about what we struggled with for that day of school and what
      our plan of attack is for the next day. It is a great opportunity for us to decompress, as well as lay out our future smart goals. It is a little difficult to really deep dive into certain subjects however since you need to concentrate on driving
      as well, So in the future if we have something complex to talk about, we will have to wait until we are home.</p>
    <p> Spend 30 minutes reading JavaScript for kids before bed.<br> No.<br> Once home I got side-tracked with conversations via phone with my good friend Chris, taking up quite a bit of my evening and costing me the window I had set aside for reading. It
      was god to talk to him, but I could have explained the situation and called him back at a time that was better for me. In the future I will be more strict with myself and save casual conversation for down time.</p>
    <p> Go to bed by 10pm.<br> Yes.<br> I didn’t agree to sit down and play video games with my room mates. Allowing me to keep track of time and get to bed at the reasonable hour I hoped for. A full night sleep is very important for learning, and since I
      don’t usually sleep well, I need to get it while I can. I think in the future I can improve my pre sleep routine, first and foremost by eliminating the 15 minutes of playing on my phone.
    </p>

    <h2>SMART Goals: Day 2.</h2>
    <p>May 5th, 2018</p>
    <p>Complete an hour long climbing session and 20 minutes of calisthenics before school.<br> Yes.<br> I woke up at 5am, hitting the snooze button once, I made up the lost time by speeding a bit to the gym. Arriving at 6:33, giving me plenty of time to
      complete my exercises and a shower before getting to school at a reasonable hour. If I had managed a better nights sleep, I probably could have been less rushed in the morning, giving me more time to enjoy breakfast and waking up.</p>
    <p> Spend an hour trying to learn GIT on my own.<br> No.<br> I didn’t have enough of a basic understanding of Git, and so I was unable to find a good starting point to begin the learning process. I realized this pretty quickly, so Instead of spinning
      my wheels for the whole hour, I chose to work on different sections of bucket 1 to continue my forward progress with things that I comprehend a bit more completely. In the future,I will ask my roommates to walk me through the basics of Git over
      the course of dinner, giving me a better idea of where I should start the process the next time I have the availability to schedule it.</p>
    <p> Spend an hour discussing the school day and plans for tomorrow with my brother.<br> Yes.<br> As per usual, the drive home is quite long, giving us plenty of time to work through what we learned throughout the day, and what we struggled with. Tomorrow
      we will be doing an upper body workout before school. We have also decided that quizzing each other on things from the day can prove to be quite beneficial. However, we quickly realized that we should really completely understand what we are quizzing
      the other person on, or else we both end up a bit confused on the subject, so tomorrow, we will be keeping it simple but relevant.</p>
    <p> Discuss meet-ups with roommates over dinner.<br> Yes.<br> We wanted the views and opinions of our roommates in regards to approaching the meetup challenge, since they have both completed the Galvanize program. So we scheduled about 30 minutes to talk
      through the importance of the meetups, and good options for scheduling and attending them. Putting us in a better mind set for tackling this challenge. It would have been beneficial to have a list of meetups we were interested in with us so that
      we could ask their opinions on them, instead of just the broad idea of meetups.
    </p>
    <h2>SMART Goals: Day 3.</h2>
    <p>May 9th, 2018</p>
    <p>Complete an hour long upper body workout before school.<br> Yes.<br> I woke up at 430am, well before my alarm went off, giving me plenty of time to pour hot water over the frozen bike racks on top of the car, and warming up the windows so we could
      see while driving, allowing us to get to the gym right on time. We ran into a slight hiccup when the machine we needed for our workout was being used by another gym patron, we resolved this problem by adjusting our exercises, allowing us to still
      have a complete workout and finish on time. The bikes are a very important part of our daily commute, so in order to prevent close calls like this, we will park my car in the garage instead of his to prevent freezing on cold, wet nights.</p>
    <p>
    Complete the short term goals drills before the end of the day.<br> Yes.<br> I was able to spend time between breakouts typing all of this up. Allowing me to post this to GitHub as I wrapped my day up here at home. It was good to complete it, as it
      made me feel less discouraged about the sections I am struggling with. In the future it might be smart for me to bounce between a couple of the more straightforward challenges, like this one, but I am not completely sure. Time will tell.</p>
    <p>
    Spend 30 minutes reading JavaScript for kids before bed.<br> Yes.<br> I avoided all distractions at home by going up to my room, and was able to sit at my desk and read uninterrupted (except for once by a curious cat) for 30 minutes. I think that
      in the future if I listen to a bit of music, and play with the cat before hand, I will be able to retain more of the information. Eat a big, healthy dinner once home from school. Yes. We were able to stop at the store on the way home from school
      and buy what we needed.</p>
    <p> We cooked up two turkey burgers a piece, and had a nice big spinach salad with them. I can definitely feel my brain working, and I am very hungry because of it. This is a great way to get it the nutrients it needs to recover every night before another
      big day. In the future we will try to meal prep dinners like we do with lunches, giving us more time to concentrate on studying and preparing for the coming days of school
