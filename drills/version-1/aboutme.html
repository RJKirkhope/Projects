    <p>My name is R.J. Kirkhope, and this is the only picture of my face I can find. I am excited to learn as much as I can about Web Developement, and I hope to persue a career as a Developer. I am a very active person and spend most of my time out of doors,
      exploring the world by Motorcycle, or climbing, skiing, and mountaineering with my friends. I thuroughly enjoy bad jokes and friendly conversation. I am a huge nerd, and spend most Sunday nights playing Dungeons and Dragons. I have a cat named Bedhead
      and he is much cuter than your cat. </p>
